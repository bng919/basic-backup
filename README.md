# basic-backup
Very basic Python command line utility to backup local Desktop and Documents folders to a drive mounted at M: which includes folder M:/Backups
This utility does record changes, rather it copies all of Desktop and Documents when run, and therefore is not very efficient but met my needs for a very simple back up solution.
To backup I connect my external drive and then run this via a shortcut on my desktop.
