# basic-backup
Very basic Python utility to backup local Desktop and Documents folders to a drive mounted at M: which includes folder M:/Backups.

This utility does record changes, rather it copies all of Desktop and Documents when run. This is not the most efficient solution, but meets my needs for very simple backup automation.
To backup I connect my external drive and then run this via a shortcut on my desktop.
